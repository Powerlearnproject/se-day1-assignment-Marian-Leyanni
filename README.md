Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the systematic use of engineering principles, tools and methodologies to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain high-quality software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of early programming languages. In the 1950s, programming languages like Fortra were developed for use.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s: The term "Software Engineering" was coined at a conference in 1968, and was gradually accepted as a discipline.
Rise of Agile methodologies and Open-source projects: In the 2000s, aglie ethodologies like Scrum and open-source programming became popular.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Here, one researches, gathers, and documents user needs and system requirements.
Design: Make detailes illustrations of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Write code and build the product according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conduct tests to ensure the software meets quality and functional requirements.
Deployment: Release the software for use by customers.
Maintenance: Continuously check the performance of software, and provide ongoing support and enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodolgy is better for projects with clear requirements and minimal expected change, while Agile works well with projects with changing requirements. While Waterfall takes a more sequential and linear approach and is less tolerant of change, Agile uses an iterative approach and responds well to change, feedback and collaboration. Nevertheless, both methodologies follow structured processes and make the customer's needs a priority.
Agile is good for cases like construction projects and building payroll systems (where clear initial instructions are cruccial, and minimal change is expected.) On the other hand, Waterfall works for video game development and social media apps (where frequent change is expected and feedback plays a big role during implementation.)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
